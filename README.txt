As required, in this file I describe some of the decisions that I made while developing this challenging project. 

Before I start, I must say, as I mentioned before, that this was a challenging project for me because when I started I had a very basic understanding of Javascript, and had never used or seen a React project before, so I took some time to study before actually start developing this project. Now I feel much more confident of what's Javascript and React, and I've also learned a bit of TypeScript, although I didn't use it here. In fact, I learned a lot and will continue studying and practicing while waiting for your feedback. I recognize that this project is far from perfect, but I hope it's enough to earn you the privilege of meeting your team and learning as much as possible.

-------------

Before I got this challenge I was studying Ruby, and I intended to go to Elixir after, but as soon as I got this challenge I had to choose between React or Phoenix, so I decided to use React because already had some basic knowledge of JavaScript.

It was developed using Visual Studio Code with the Prettier extension to format the code.

To make requests to the API I used the Axios library, which I considered an easier and cleaner way to make HTTP requisitions than the "fetch()" method.

I was unable develop automated tests. I thought about taking more time to learn about them but when I was doing that I realized that it would take longer, and although I wasn't given a deadline I didn't want to push it too much more so I decided to show it as it is, but I'll definitely learn in the coming days.

Also, about the optional requirement of building a cache, I was unable to develop it for the same reason. I was checking some ways to do this like the native Javascript APIs "localStorage" and "sessionStorage" or React Query, but I still didn't understand enough about it to apply it here.
